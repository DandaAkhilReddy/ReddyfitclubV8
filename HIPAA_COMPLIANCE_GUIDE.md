## Overview

### Why HIPAA Compliance Matters

ReddyFit Club V8 processes **Protected Health Information (PHI)** including:
- Body composition measurements
- Medical images (body scans)
- Health recommendations
- Personal identifiers

As a **Health Information Technology (HIT) system**, we must comply with:
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **HITECH Act** (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health)
- **State privacy laws** (California CCPA, etc.)

**Penalties for Non-Compliance**:
- Tier 1: $100-$50,000 per violation (unknowing)
- Tier 2: $1,000-$50,000 per violation (reasonable cause)
- Tier 3: $10,000-$50,000 per violation (willful neglect, corrected)
- Tier 4: $50,000+ per violation (willful neglect, not corrected)
- **Maximum annual penalty**: $1.5 million per violation type
- **Criminal penalties**: Up to 10 years imprisonment

### Our Commitment

‚úÖ **Privacy-First Architecture**: PHI encrypted at rest and in transit
‚úÖ **Minimum Necessary**: Only access PHI required for the task
‚úÖ **Patient Control**: Users can export, correct, or delete their data
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: All PHI access logged and monitored
‚úÖ **Vendor Due Diligence**: BAAs with all third-party processors

---

## HIPAA Fundamentals

### The Three Rules

#### 1. Privacy Rule

**Purpose**: Sets standards for protecting PHI

**Key Requirements**:
- Patients must authorize PHI disclosure
- Minimum necessary disclosure
- Patients have right to access, amend, and receive accounting of disclosures
- Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) must be provided

**ReddyFit Implementation**:
```typescript
// Consent collection on signup
interface PrivacyConsent {
  scanAnalysisConsent: boolean;      // Required
  dataSharingConsent: boolean;       // Optional (trainer access)
  researchConsent: boolean;          // Optional (de-identified data for research)
  marketingConsent: boolean;         // Optional (promotional emails)
  consentDate: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
}
```

#### 2. Security Rule

**Purpose**: Sets standards for protecting ePHI (electronic PHI)

**Key Requirements**:
- Access controls
- Audit controls
- Integrity controls
- Transmission security

**ReddyFit Implementation**: See [Technical Safeguards](#technical-safeguards)

#### 3. Breach Notification Rule

**Purpose**: Requires notification of PHI breaches

**Trigger**: Breach affecting 500+ individuals

**Timeline**:
- **< 500 individuals**: Notify within 60 days
- **‚â• 500 individuals**: Notify HHS + media within 60 days
- **Employees/workforce**: No delay, immediate notification

**ReddyFit Implementation**: See [Breach Notification](#breach-notification)

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

### What is PHI?

PHI = **Any individually identifiable health information** held or transmitted by a covered entity or business associate.

### 18 HIPAA Identifiers

| Identifier | Example in ReddyFit | Stored? |
|------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1. Names | Full name | ‚úÖ Yes (Firestore) |
| 2. Geographic subdivisions smaller than state | City, ZIP code | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 3. Dates (except year) | Scan date (2025-10-07) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 4. Telephone numbers | User phone | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |
| 5. Email addresses | user@example.com | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 6. Social Security numbers | N/A | ‚ùå No |
| 7. Medical record numbers | N/A | ‚ùå No |
| 8. Health plan beneficiary numbers | N/A | ‚ùå No |
| 9. Account numbers | Stripe customer ID | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 10. Certificate/license numbers | N/A | ‚ùå No |
| 11. Vehicle identifiers | N/A | ‚ùå No |
| 12. Device identifiers | Firebase device token | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 13. URLs | User profile URL | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 14. IP addresses | Request IP (audit logs) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 15. Biometric identifiers | Body scan images | ‚úÖ **Yes (CRITICAL)** |
| 16. Full face photos | Profile photo, scan images | ‚úÖ **Yes (CRITICAL)** |
| 17. Any unique identifying number | Firebase UID | ‚úÖ Yes |
| 18. Any other unique characteristic | QR slug | ‚úÖ Yes |

### PHI in ReddyFit

#### Direct PHI (Requires Maximum Protection)

```typescript
// ‚ùó CRITICAL PHI - Must be encrypted, audited, access-controlled
const criticalPHI = {
  // Biometric identifiers
  bodyScans: {
    frontImage: "Azure Blob URL (encrypted)",
    backImage: "Azure Blob URL (encrypted)",
    leftImage: "Azure Blob URL (encrypted)",
    rightImage: "Azure Blob URL (encrypted)"
  },

  // Health measurements
  bodyComposition: {
    bodyFatPercent: 15.5,
    leanBodyMass: 153,
    visceralFat: 8
  },

  // Personal identifiers
  user: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    dateOfBirth: "1990-05-15", // ‚ùó Date identifier
    profilePhoto: "URL"         // ‚ùó Full face photo
  }
};
```

#### De-identified Data (HIPAA Safe Harbor)

To use data for analytics, we **de-identify** by removing all 18 identifiers:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ De-identified - Safe for analytics
const deidentifiedData = {
  scanId: "random-uuid", // No relation to user
  ageRange: "30-35",     // Not exact age
  gender: "male",
  bodyFatRange: "15-20", // Binned data
  region: "West Coast",  // State level only
  scanMonth: "2025-10"   // Month only, no exact date
};
```

**Safe Harbor Method**: Remove all 18 identifiers + statistical certainty that data cannot be re-identified.

---

## Technical Safeguards

### 1. Access Control (¬ß164.312(a)(1))

**Requirement**: Implement technical policies to allow only authorized access to ePHI.

#### Unique User Identification (¬ß164.312(a)(2)(i))

```typescript
// Every user has unique Firebase UID
interface AuthenticatedUser {
  uid: string;           // Unique identifier (never reused)
  email: string;
  mfaVerified: boolean;  // Required for PHI access
  role: 'patient' | 'trainer' | 'admin';
  permissions: string[]; // Granular permissions
}
```

#### Emergency Access Procedure (¬ß164.312(a)(2)(ii))

```typescript
// Break-glass access for emergencies
interface EmergencyAccess {
  accessType: 'emergency';
  accessedBy: string;           // Admin UID
  reason: string;               // Documented reason
  timestamp: Date;
  patientsAccessed: string[];   // List of user IDs
  approvedBy: string;           // Supervisor UID
  auditTrail: AuditEvent[];
}

// Log emergency access immediately
await logEmergencyAccess({
  accessedBy: 'admin-uid-123',
  reason: 'User reported medical emergency, needed to contact trainer',
  patientsAccessed: ['user-uid-456'],
  approvedBy: 'supervisor-uid-789'
});
```

#### Automatic Logoff (¬ß164.312(a)(2)(iii))

```typescript
// Frontend: Auto-logout after 15 minutes idle
let idleTimer: NodeJS.Timeout;

function resetIdleTimer() {
  clearTimeout(idleTimer);
  idleTimer = setTimeout(async () => {
    await firebase.auth().signOut();
    // Log session timeout
    await auditLog('session_timeout', { reason: 'idle_15_minutes' });
    window.location.href = '/login?reason=timeout';
  }, 15 * 60 * 1000); // 15 minutes
}

// Reset timer on user activity
window.addEventListener('mousemove', resetIdleTimer);
window.addEventListener('keydown', resetIdleTimer);
```

#### Encryption (¬ß164.312(a)(2)(iv))

```typescript
// All PHI encrypted at rest (AES-256)
const encryptionConfig = {
  algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
  keySource: 'Azure Key Vault',
  keyRotation: '90 days',
  encryption: {
    atRest: {
      azureBlob: 'Customer-Managed Key (CMK)',
      firestore: 'Google-Managed Key',
      auditLogs: 'Microsoft-Managed Key'
    },
    inTransit: {
      tls: 'TLS 1.3',
      cipherSuites: ['TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384']
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Audit Controls (¬ß164.312(b))

**Requirement**: Implement hardware, software, and procedural mechanisms to record and examine activity in systems containing ePHI.

```typescript
// Comprehensive audit logging
interface AuditEvent {
  eventId: string;
  timestamp: Date;

  // Who
  actorId: string;           // User or system performing action
  actorRole: 'patient' | 'trainer' | 'admin' | 'system';

  // What
  action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'export' | 'print';
  resourceType: 'scan' | 'user_profile' | 'medical_record';
  resourceId: string;

  // Where
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  location: string;          // Geo-location (city/state)

  // Why (optional)
  reason?: string;           // For emergency access

  // Result
  success: boolean;
  errorMessage?: string;

  // PHI accessed
  phiAccessed: boolean;      // Flag if PHI was involved
  phiTypes: string[];        // ['scan_images', 'body_composition']
}

// Example: Log PHI read access
await auditLog({
  actorId: 'user-123',
  actorRole: 'patient',
  action: 'read',
  resourceType: 'scan',
  resourceId: 'scn_456',
  ipAddress: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
  success: true,
  phiAccessed: true,
  phiTypes: ['scan_images', 'body_composition', 'ai_recommendations']
});
```

**Audit Log Retention**: 7 years (HIPAA requirement)

### 3. Integrity (¬ß164.312(c)(1))

**Requirement**: Protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction.

```typescript
// Firestore: Immutable scan records
const scanDocRef = firestore.collection('scans').doc(scanId);

// Create only (no updates to historical data)
await scanDocRef.set({
  ...scanData,
  createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  hash: sha256(JSON.stringify(scanData)), // Integrity check
  version: 1,
  mutable: false
});

// Prevent deletion (HIPAA retention)
// Firestore Security Rules
match /scans/{scanId} {
  allow delete: if false; // Never allow deletion

  // Updates only for specific fields (not PHI)
  allow update: if request.resource.data.diff(resource.data)
    .affectedKeys()
    .hasOnly(['processingStatus', 'updatedAt']);
}
```

**Change Tracking**:
```typescript
// Track all changes to PHI
interface ChangeLog {
  documentId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  changedBy: string;
  changeType: 'create' | 'update';
  fieldsBefore: Record<string, any>;
  fieldsAfter: Record<string, any>;
  reason: string;
}
```

### 4. Transmission Security (¬ß164.312(e)(1))

**Requirement**: Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI transmitted over a network.

```typescript
// TLS 1.3 enforced
const tlsConfig = {
  minVersion: 'TLSv1.3',
  cipherSuites: [
    'TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384',
    'TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256'
  ],
  // Reject old protocols
  rejectUnauthorized: true,
  // Certificate pinning
  checkServerIdentity: (host, cert) => {
    const expectedFingerprint = process.env.AZURE_CERT_FINGERPRINT;
    if (cert.fingerprint256 !== expectedFingerprint) {
      throw new Error('Certificate pinning failed');
    }
  }
};

// Azure API Management: Enforce HTTPS
{
  "properties": {
    "protocols": {
      "http": false,  // ‚ùå Disabled
      "https": true   // ‚úÖ Required
    },
    "tlsVersion": "1.3"
  }
}
```

#### Risk Analysis (¬ß164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A))

```markdown
# Annual Risk Assessment

**Assets Containing PHI**:
1. Azure Blob Storage (scan images)
2. Firestore database (user profiles, scan metadata)
3. Azure Monitor (audit logs)
4. Temporal Cloud (workflow execution logs)
5. Supermemory (agent context data)

**Threats**:
1. Unauthorized access (external hackers, internal bad actors)
2. Data breach (stolen credentials, phishing)
3. Ransomware attack
4. Insider threat (employee accessing unauthorized PHI)
5. Vendor breach (third-party service compromised)

**Vulnerabilities**:
1. Weak passwords (mitigated by MFA)
2. Unpatched software (mitigated by auto-updates)
3. Social engineering (mitigated by training)
4. Third-party dependencies (mitigated by BAAs, audits)

**Risk Scores** (Likelihood √ó Impact):
| Risk | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| Unauthorized access | 2 | 5 | 10 | MFA, IP allowlisting, audit logs |
| Ransomware | 3 | 5 | 15 | Backups, EDR, employee training |
| Vendor breach | 2 | 4 | 8 | BAAs, vendor audits, monitoring |
| Insider threat | 1 | 5 | 5 | RBAC, least privilege, audit logs |
```

**Action Plan**: Mitigate all risks with score ‚â• 10 within 90 days.

#### Risk Management (¬ß164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B))

```typescript
// Implement controls to reduce identified risks
const riskMitigations = {
  unauthorizedAccess: [
    'Implement MFA (mandatory)',
    'IP allowlisting for admin access',
    'Real-time monitoring of suspicious activity',
    'Auto-lockout after 5 failed login attempts'
  ],
  ransomware: [
    'Daily automated backups (Azure Backup)',
    'Immutable backup storage (7-year retention)',
    'Endpoint detection & response (EDR)',
    'Employee security training (quarterly)'
  ],
  vendorBreach: [
    'Sign BAAs with all vendors',
    'Annual vendor security audits',
    'Monitor vendor security advisories',
    'Incident response plan with vendor SLAs'
  ]
};
```

#### Sanction Policy (¬ß164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C))

```markdown
# Sanctions for HIPAA Violations

**Minor Violations** (e.g., forgot to lock screen once):
- Verbal warning
- Mandatory retraining

**Moderate Violations** (e.g., accessed PHI without authorization):
- Written warning
- Suspension without pay (1-5 days)
- Mandatory retraining + 30-day probation

**Severe Violations** (e.g., intentionally disclosed PHI):
- Immediate termination
- Report to law enforcement (if criminal)
- Civil lawsuit (if damages occurred)

All sanctions documented in employee file.
```

### Workforce Training (¬ß164.308(a)(5))

## Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### What is a BAA?

A **Business Associate Agreement** is a contract ensuring that third-party vendors handling PHI comply with HIPAA.

### When BAA is Required

‚úÖ **Required** if vendor has access to PHI:
- Microsoft Azure (hosting)
- Google Cloud / Firebase (database)
- Temporal.io (workflow logs may contain PHI)
- Supermemory / Overlap.ai (agent context with PHI)
- Stripe (payment processing with identifiers)

‚ùå **Not Required** if vendor has no PHI access:
- CodeRabbit (code review, no PHI in code)
- GitHub (source code only)
- Vercel / Azure Static Web Apps (static assets only)

### BAA Checklist

All BAAs must include:

```markdown
# BAA Requirements Checklist

## Audit Controls & Logging

### Audit Log Requirements

**What to Log** (¬ß164.312(b)):
- All PHI access (read, write, update, delete)
- Authentication events (login, logout, MFA, failed attempts)
- Authorization failures (attempted access to unauthorized PHI)
- Configuration changes (security settings, user permissions)
- Breach attempts (suspicious activity, anomalies)

**What NOT to Log**:
- Passwords (even hashed)
- Session tokens (except last 4 chars)
- Full credit card numbers
- Sensitive user data unless already PHI

### Audit Log Schema

```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  // Unique identifier
  logId: string;
  timestamp: Date;

  // Actor (who)
  actorId: string;
  actorType: 'user' | 'admin' | 'system' | 'api_client';
  actorRole: string;
  actorEmail: string;

  // Action (what)
  action: string; // 'read_scan', 'update_profile', 'export_data'
  actionCategory: 'phi_access' | 'auth' | 'config' | 'breach_attempt';

  // Resource (what was accessed)
  resourceType: 'scan' | 'user_profile' | 'audit_log';
  resourceId: string;
  resourceOwner: string; // User ID whose PHI was accessed

  // Context (where/how)
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  geolocation: { city: string; state: string; country: string };
  sessionId: string;

  // Result
  success: boolean;
  errorCode?: string;
  errorMessage?: string;

  // PHI Tracking
  phiAccessed: boolean;
  phiTypes: string[]; // ['scan_images', 'body_composition']
  phiCount: number;   // Number of PHI records accessed

  // Compliance
  legalBasis: 'consent' | 'treatment' | 'payment' | 'operations' | 'emergency';
  minimumNecessary: boolean; // Was minimum necessary principle followed?
}
```

### Audit Log Implementation

```typescript
// src/lib/audit/auditLogger.ts
import { Firestore } from 'firebase-admin/firestore';

export class AuditLogger {
  private db: Firestore;

  async logPhiAccess(event: {
    actorId: string;
    action: string;
    resourceType: string;
    resourceId: string;
    resourceOwner: string;
    phiTypes: string[];
    ipAddress: string;
    userAgent: string;
  }): Promise<void> {
    const logEntry: AuditLogEntry = {
      logId: `audit_${Date.now()}_${randomUUID()}`,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      actorId: event.actorId,
      actorType: 'user',
      action: event.action,
      actionCategory: 'phi_access',
      resourceType: event.resourceType,
      resourceId: event.resourceId,
      resourceOwner: event.resourceOwner,
      ipAddress: event.ipAddress,
      userAgent: event.userAgent,

      phiTypes: event.phiTypes,
      phiCount: 1,
      legalBasis: 'consent',
      minimumNecessary: true
    };

    // Write to Firestore audit_logs collection
    await this.db.collection('audit_logs').doc(logEntry.logId).set(logEntry);

    // Also send to Azure Monitor for long-term archival
    await this.sendToAzureMonitor(logEntry);
  }

  async logFailedAccess(event: {
    actorId: string;
    attemptedAction: string;
    reason: string;
  }): Promise<void> {
    // Log unauthorized access attempts
    await this.db.collection('audit_logs').add({
      ...event,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      actionCategory: 'breach_attempt',
      success: false,
      phiAccessed: false
    });

    // Alert security team if multiple failed attempts
    if (await this.detectSuspiciousActivity(event.actorId)) {
      await this.alertSecurityTeam(event);
    }
  }

  private async detectSuspiciousActivity(actorId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check for 5+ failed attempts in last hour
    const oneHourAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 60 * 60 * 1000);
    const failedAttempts = await this.db
      .collection('audit_logs')
      .where('actorId', '==', actorId)
      .where('success', '==', false)
      .where('timestamp', '>', oneHourAgo)
      .count()
      .get();

    return failedAttempts.data().count >= 5;
  }
}
```

### Audit Log Monitoring

```yaml
# Azure Monitor Alerts
Alerts:
  - name: "Suspicious PHI Access"
    query: |
      AuditLogs
      | where phiAccessed == true
      | summarize count() by actorId, bin(timestamp, 1h)
      | where count_ > 100  // More than 100 PHI accesses/hour
    action: "Email security team + lock account"

  - name: "Failed Authentication Spike"
    query: |
      AuditLogs
      | where action == "login_failed"
      | summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
      | where count_ > 10
    action: "Email + PagerDuty"

  - name: "After-Hours PHI Access"
    query: |
      AuditLogs
      | where phiAccessed == true
      | where hourofday(timestamp) < 6 or hourofday(timestamp) > 22
    action: "Email compliance officer"
```

### Audit Log Retention

**HIPAA Requirement**: 6 years minimum

**ReddyFit Policy**: **7 years**

```typescript
// Automated audit log archival
// Azure Function (runs daily)
export async function archiveOldAuditLogs(): Promise<void> {
  const sevenYearsAgo = new Date();
  sevenYearsAgo.setFullYear(sevenYearsAgo.getFullYear() - 7);

  // Move logs older than 7 years to cold storage
  const oldLogs = await firestore
    .collection('audit_logs')
    .where('timestamp', '<', sevenYearsAgo)
    .get();

  for (const log of oldLogs.docs) {
    // Archive to Azure Blob (immutable storage)
    await azureBlobClient.uploadBlockBlob(
      'audit-archives',
      `${log.id}.json`,
      JSON.stringify(log.data())
    );

    // Delete from Firestore (cost optimization)
    await log.ref.delete();
  }
}
```

## Breach Notification

### What is a Breach?

A breach is the **unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI** that compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ **Reportable Breach**: Laptop stolen with unencrypted PHI
- ‚úÖ **Reportable Breach**: Hacker gains access to database, downloads PHI
- ‚úÖ **Reportable Breach**: Employee emails PHI to wrong recipient
- ‚ùå **Not a Breach**: Encrypted laptop stolen (data unreadable without key)
- ‚ùå **Not a Breach**: PHI disclosed to another covered entity for treatment

### Breach Risk Assessment

After discovering a potential breach, perform **Risk Assessment**:

```markdown
# Breach Risk Assessment (within 24 hours)

1. **Nature and Extent**
   - What PHI was involved? (scan images, body composition, etc.)
   - How many individuals affected? (<500 or ‚â•500?)

2. **Person Who Used/Disclosed PHI**
   - Was it unauthorized? (e.g., hacker vs. employee mistake)

3. **Was PHI Actually Acquired/Viewed?**
   - Server logs show data was accessed? (vs. just exposed)

4. **Mitigation**
   - Was PHI encrypted? (Safe harbor exception)
   - Was PHI destroyed before access?

**Decision**:
- **Low Risk** ‚Üí No notification required (document decision)
- **High Risk** ‚Üí Proceed with breach notification
```

### Breach Notification Timeline

```
Day 0: Breach Discovered

## Patient Rights

### 1. Right to Access (¬ß164.524)

**Requirement**: Individuals have the right to access their PHI.

**Timeline**: Provide access within **30 days** of request (45 days if PHI offsite)

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// User can download all their data
export async function exportUserData(userId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Log PHI access
  await auditLogger.logPhiAccess({
    actorId: userId,
    action: 'export_data',
    resourceType: 'user_all_data',
    resourceOwner: userId,
    phiTypes: ['scans', 'profile', 'recommendations']
  });

  // Gather all user data
  const userData = {
    profile: await getUserProfile(userId),
    scans: await getAllScans(userId),
    nutrition: await getNutritionLogs(userId),
    workouts: await getWorkoutLogs(userId),
    subscription: await getSubscriptionData(userId)
  };

  // Generate PDF or JSON
  const dataExport = await generateDataExport(userData, 'pdf');

  // Send download link via email
  await sendEmail(user.email, {
    subject: 'Your ReddyFit Data Export',
    body: `Your data export is ready: ${dataExport.url}`,
    attachments: [dataExport]
  });
}
```

**Implementation**:

```typescript
export async function requestAmendment(
  userId: string,
  field: string,

): Promise<void> {
  // Create amendment request
  const request = await firestore.collection('amendment_requests').add({
    userId,
    field,
    oldValue,
    newValue,
    reason,
    status: 'pending',
    requestedAt: new Date()
  });

  // Notify compliance officer for review
  await notifyComplianceOfficer(request.id);
